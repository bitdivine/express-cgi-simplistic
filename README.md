======================

This is a very simple nodejs CGI server that uses express.  It works.  It is intended as a gist to help get other projects started quickly.

# Platforms:
Any UNIX, Linux or Mac.

# Installation:

Run:

    npm install

Start the server with:

    npm start

Now you can use the CGI script to echo your name back to you:

    bash bin/test.sh
